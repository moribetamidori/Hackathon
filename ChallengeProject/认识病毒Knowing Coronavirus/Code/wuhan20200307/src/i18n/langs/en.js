They belong to the Betacoronavirus of the nested virus family. [31] [9] [32] [33] the genome length of each group of the virus is about 30000 nucleotides. The [8] [34] [35] gene sequence shows that sars-cov-2 belongs to a virus with a long branch in the evolutionary tree of beta coronavirus lineage Î² (sarbecovirus), [36] is similar to the coronavirus found in the Chinese Rhinolophus, such as mers cov or SARS CoV."
